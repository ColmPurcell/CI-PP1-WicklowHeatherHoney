            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>We here at Wicklow Heather Honey are passionate about bees and beekeeping. We want to encourage the next
                generation of beekeepers and if you have any beekeeping questions we would be happy to help, find our
                contact details on our contact page <a href="contact.html">here</a>. </p>
            <p>All our honey is 100% natural, produced by native Irish bees who collect their nectar from the heather
                plants that grow in the foothills of the Wicklow Mountains.</p>
            <p>Research has <a

                that heather honey has comparable health benefits to manuka honey and because all our honey is locally
                produced you'll not only reap the health benefits but you'll also be kinder to the environment.
