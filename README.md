## Design

### Colour Scheme:

Text colours of darkslategrey and darkslateblue in combination with the off white background colour of #F9F9F0 used for the body of the page allow for easy readability while not being overwhelming. The website [mycolor.space](https://mycolor.space/) aws used to create the color palette.
